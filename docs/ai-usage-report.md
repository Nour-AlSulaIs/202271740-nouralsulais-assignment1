# AI Usage Report

## Tools Used & Use Cases

### ChatGPT

I used ChatGPT as a learning and support tool throughout this assignment. It was mainly used for:

- Debugging CSS layout and alignment issues (Flexbox & Grid)
- Improving responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile screens
- Implementing a Dark/Light mode toggle using JavaScript
- Creating and refining the typing animation for the "Software Engineer" tagline

ChatGPT was primarily used for explanations, debugging guidance, and learning new techniques rather than automatically generating the entire project.

## Benefits & Challenges

### Benefits

- Helped identify CSS mistakes and structural layout issues quickly
- Improved my understanding of responsive design principles
- Introduced better ways to structure layouts using Flexbox and Grid
- Assisted in implementing theme switching logic properly


### Challenges

- Not all generated solutions matched my design goals directly
- I needed to manually test and verify all suggestions using browser DevTools
- Some adjustments were necessary to maintain consistency across dark and light modes

## Learning Outcomes

Using AI introduced me to new techniques and development approaches that improved both my technical skills and workflow.

Through this assignment, I learned:

- How to properly structure responsive layouts using Flexbox and Grid
- How to apply media queries effectively for mobile and tablet responsiveness
- How to implement theme toggling using class manipulation in JavaScript
- How to debug layout issues more systematically

AI enhanced my learning process and helped me discover more efficient development practices.

## Responsible Use & Modifications

All AI-generated suggestions were carefully reviewed before implementation.


- Tested every suggested solution manually
- Modified layout and styling to match my design requirements
- Ensured that the final implementation reflects my own understanding
- Adjusted design decisions to maintain originality and consistency
- Verified responsiveness using browser resizing and DevTools

AI was used as a supportive learning assistant. The final code structure, design decisions, and refinements were implemented and customized by me.
